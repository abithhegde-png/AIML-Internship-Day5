# AI & ML Internship – Day 5

## Task: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset Used
- Heart Disease Dataset

### Work Done
- Loaded the Heart Disease dataset using Pandas
- Identified input features and target variable
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Predicted results on test data
- Calculated accuracy, precision, and recall
- Created and analyzed the confusion matrix

### Key Learnings
- Train-test split helps evaluate model performance
- Logistic Regression is used for classification problems
- Accuracy shows overall correctness of the model
- Precision shows how many predicted positives are correct
- Recall shows how many actual positives are detected
- Confusion matrix helps understand prediction results
